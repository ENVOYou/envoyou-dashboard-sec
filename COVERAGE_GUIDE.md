## 🚀 Coverage Improvement Plan

### High Priority (Next Sprint)
1. **API Client** - Add more endpoint tests
2. **Auth Components** - Test AuthGuard and authentication flows
3. **Error Boundaries** - Add error handling tests

### Medium Priority (Next 2 Sprints)
1. **Dashboard Components** - Test sidebar, charts, calculations
2. **Form Components** - Test validation and submission
3. **Data Display** - Test data formatting and edge cases

### Low Priority (Future Sprints)
1. **Utility Functions** - Test helper functions
2. **Constants** - Test configuration values
3. **Type Definitions** - Test type guards

## 🛠️ Coverage Tools & Commands

### Local Development
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Check coverage thresholds
npm run test:coverage:check

# Enforce coverage gates
npm run test:coverage:enforce

# View coverage report
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

### CI/CD Integration
- **Coverage Reports**: Automatically generated on PRs
- **Quality Gates**: PRs blocked if coverage < 70%
- **Trend Analysis**: Coverage changes tracked over time
- **Team Notifications**: Alerts for coverage regressions

## 📈 Coverage Metrics

### What Gets Measured
- **Statements**: Code statements executed
- **Branches**: Conditional branches covered
- **Functions**: Functions called during tests
- **Lines**: Lines of code tested

### Coverage Exclusions
- **Type Definitions**: `.d.ts` files
- **Configuration**: Next.js config files
- **Static Assets**: Images, fonts, etc.
- **Third-party Libraries**: Node modules

## 🎯 Quality Gates

### Automated Gates
1. **PR Coverage Check**: Minimum 70% overall coverage
2. **Component Coverage**: UI components must have ≥80% coverage
3. **Regression Detection**: Coverage cannot decrease by >5%
4. **Bundle Size**: JavaScript bundle ≤500KB

### Manual Gates
1. **Code Review**: All new features must have tests
2. **Test Quality**: Tests must cover happy path + error cases
3. **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions must be tested
4. **Integration**: API integration must be tested

## 📊 Coverage Reports

### Local Reports
- **HTML Report**: `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`
- **JSON Summary**: `coverage/coverage-summary.json`
- **LCOV Format**: `coverage/lcov.info`

### CI/CD Reports
- **Codecov Integration**: https://codecov.io/gh/your-repo
- **GitHub Comments**: Coverage reports posted on PRs
- **Trend Analysis**: Coverage changes over time

## 🚨 Coverage Alerts

### Automated Alerts
- **Coverage Regression**: Alert when coverage drops >5%
- **Bundle Size Increase**: Alert when bundle size grows >10%
- **Test Failures**: Alert when tests fail in CI/CD

### Manual Reviews
- **Monthly Reviews**: Coverage trends and improvement plans
- **Sprint Reviews**: Coverage goals and achievements
- **Code Reviews**: Test coverage requirements

## 💡 Coverage Best Practices

### Writing Tests
1. **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Focus on what the code does
2. **Cover Edge Cases**: Test null, undefined, empty values
3. **Test Error Scenarios**: Verify error handling works
4. **Use Descriptive Names**: Test names should explain intent

### Test Organization
1. **One Feature, One File**: Group related tests together
2. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear test structure
3. **Given-When-Then**: BDD-style test naming
4. **Helper Functions**: Reuse common test setup

### Coverage Goals
1. **Start Small**: Focus on critical paths first
2. **Iterate**: Add tests as you add features
3. **Maintain**: Keep coverage above thresholds
4. **Improve**: Gradually increase coverage targets
